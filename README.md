Hi! Glad you visited. This is a demo for OAuth with JSon Web Token using passport module of NPM.

Steps to Install and Run
-------------
 1. Clone or download zip for the repo.
 2. Run `'npm install'` using command line
 3. To run the app, `'npm start'` -- Check for 'App is running' on console.
 4. Check and hack users.js to add/remove users.
 5. Request to API with email and password in request body. Response will contain Authorization key if request is valid.
 6. Use Authorization key recieved in HTTP header for consequent requests.
 7. Try for a few more times. Gets boring hence.
